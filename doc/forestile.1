forestile - tiled layout generator for river
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[I]forestile\f[R] [\f[I]options\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[I]forestile\f[R] is a layout generator for \f[I]river\f[R](1).
It provides a simple tiled layout with split main/secondary stacks.
The initial state may be configured with various options passed on
startup.
Some values may additionally be modified while forestile is running with
the help of \f[I]riverctl\f[R](1).
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\f[I]-h\f[R] Print a help message and exit.
.PP
\f[I]-version\f[R] Print the version number and exit.
.PP
\f[I]-view-padding\f[R] \f[I]pixels\f[R] Set the padding around views in
pixels.
(Default: 6)
.PP
\f[I]-outer-padding\f[R] \f[I]pixels\f[R] Set the padding around the
edge of the layout area in pixels.
(Default: 6)
.PP
\f[I]-main-location\f[R]
[\f[I]top\f[R]|\f[I]bottom\f[R]|\f[I]left\f[R]|\f[I]right\f[R]] Set the
initial location of the main area in the layout.
(Default: \f[I]left\f[R])
.PP
\f[I]-main-count\f[R] \f[I]count\f[R] Set the initial number of views in
the main area of the layout.
(Default: 1)
.PP
\f[I]-main-ratio\f[R] \f[I]ratio\f[R] Set the initial ratio of the main
area to total layout area.
The \f[I]ratio\f[R] must be between 0.1 and 0.9, inclusive.
(Default: 0.6)
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
These commands may be sent to forestile at runtime with the help of
\f[I]riverctl\f[R](1).
.PP
\f[I]main-location\f[R]
[\f[I]top\f[R]|\f[I]bottom\f[R]|\f[I]left\f[R]|\f[I]right\f[R]] Set the
location of the main area in the layout.
.PP
\f[I]main-count\f[R] \f[I]value\f[R] Set or modify the number of views
in the main area of the layout.
If \f[I]value\f[R] is prefixed by a +/- sign, \f[I]value\f[R] is
added/subtracted from the current count.
If there is no sign, the main count is set to \f[I]value\f[R].
.PP
\f[I]main-ratio\f[R] \f[I]value\f[R] Set or modify the ratio of the main
area to total layout area.
If \f[I]value\f[R] is prefixed by a +/- sign, \f[I]value\f[R] is
added/subtracted from the current ratio.
If there is no sign, the main ratio is set to \f[I]value\f[R].
Note that the ratio will always be clamped to the range 0.1 to 0.9.
.PP
\f[I]padding\f[R] [\f[I]on\f[R]|\f[I]off\f[R]|\f[I]toggle\f[R]] Set or
toggle padding for both inner and outer padding.
On and off set the value, while toggle will alternate between on and
off.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Start \f[I]forestile\f[R] with 4 pixels outer padding and the
\f[I]top\f[R] main location:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
forestile -outer-padding 4 -main-location top
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Increase the main ratio by 0.1 at runtime:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
riverctl send-layout-cmd forestile \[dq]main-ratio +0.1\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Set the main count to 3 at runtime:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
riverctl send-layout-cmd forestile \[dq]main-count 3\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
